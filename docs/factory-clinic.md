# The "Which Factory?" Clinic — Lab 4, Part D

> Week 3's hard part was refusing a pattern. **This week's hard part is telling three very

## D1 — The experiment: what does a fourth theme cost? · 8 pts

The Abstract Factory's whole claim is *"adding a new family is cheap and touches nothing
else."* Claims like that should be measured, not believed.

**Add a fourth theme.** Anything you like — Fungal, Drowned, Clockwork. It needs a kit class,
a couple of monster blueprints in `monsters.json`, and loot.

Before you start, **commit your current work** so `git diff --stat` is meaningful.

| Question | Your answer |
|---|---|
| How many **new** files did you create? | 1|
| How many **existing** files did you modify? | 3|
| Which existing files? |monsters.json, ThemeRegistry, and config.json |
| Did `GameWorld.java` change? | No|
| Did any `RoomPopulator` subclass change? | No|
| Did `Monster`, `Room`, or `DungeonLevel` change? | No|

**Paste the output of `git diff --stat`:**

```bash
$ git diff --stat

**In two or three sentences: what does that number tell you about the Open/Closed
Principle — "open for extension, closed for modification"? Was it satisfied, and how do you
know from evidence rather than from a definition?** 

There was quite a bit that needed to be extended just to add an additional level with its own class, 
though we made a minor modification to a single class to implement it. I think it was satisfied quite well 
since there was but a single modification to a single class to get it to work.


> Set `dungeonDepth` to 4 in `config.json` and run it, so you can see your fourth theme.
> Then set it back to 3 before you open the PR.

## D2 — Classification · 12 pts

For each scenario: which of the three applies? Answer **Simple Factory**, **Factory Method**,
**Abstract Factory**, or **none of them** — and give a one-sentence reason.

| # | Scenario | Which? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | One place in the code turns a monster id string into a `Monster`, so `new Monster` appears once | Simple Factory| We only needed to implement it once because we would use an Abstract Factory to give variation to it with the ThemeKits. |
| 2 | A boss room, a treasure room and an ordinary room each fill themselves differently, but always in the same order: prose, then monsters, then a chest | Factory Method | The Factory Method was just complex enough of a method to give us reusable code to make the individual types of rooms, while an Abstract Factory would be too much for the job.|
| 3 | An ice level must contain ice monsters AND ice loot AND ice prose, never a mix | Abstract Factory| To accomplish this task we needed to make an abstract family to ensure that we kept to the theme of each level. |
| 4 | Week 9: a weapon can be made flaming, then vampiric, then blessed, in any combination | None | We don't need a Factory of any kind for this, plus we didn't do this this week.|
| 5 | Week 12: save files must be written as JSON now and possibly as XML later, with matched reader and writer | Abstract Factory | We would need to make a family to make sure we can make a save file at any point.|
| 6 | A method returns a `Player` object, built from the name typed at startup | None| This would be created at start-up. |

> Scenarios 4 and 6 are traps. One is a different pattern entirely; the other is not a pattern
> at all. Say so if you think so — "none of them" is a correct answer to at least one row.

## D3 — The distinction, in your own words · 5 pts

**Simple Factory is not one of the Gang of Four patterns.** Your textbook says so explicitly
before it teaches Factory Method.

**In three or four sentences: what can Factory Method do that Simple Factory cannot?** Do not
define either one. Describe a change someone might ask you to make, and explain why it would
be easy with one and awkward with the other.

A Factory Method can allow subclasses to change or extend which type of object gets created without modifying any existing creation code, while a Simple Factory cannot do this. 
Say there is a need for multiple types of yarn, a Simple would only be able to come up with a few single color yarn skeins. 
A Factory Method, on the other hand, would be able to make subclasses to make skeins of multi-colored yarn. 

## D4 — One honest question

What is still blurry about these three patterns? A specific confusion is worth more to me
than a confident summary.

How can I determine when to use a Simple Factory over a Factory Method, or even a Factory Method over an Abstract Factory?
I find it a little difficult to tell when to use which one would be applicable where. I get that an Abstract Factory would be used
for when you have a family of code you need to bunch together, but other than that I'm still confused.
